I am currently a Master student studying Computer Science at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/) & [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl). My track is Big Data Engineering.\
\
My research interests mainly lie in translating clinical questions into a problem that can be interpreted by AI models and mining medical data.

I received my BSc in Software Engineering from the [Macau University of Science and Technology](https://www.must.edu.mo/en). My supervisor is Dr. [Subrota kumar mondal](https://www.must.edu.mo/scse/staff/subrota). The thesis is Using Different Deep Learning Models to Detect COVID-19.
