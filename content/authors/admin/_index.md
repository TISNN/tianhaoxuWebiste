### SHORT BIO

<!--EndFragment-->

**I am currently a Master student studying Computer Science at the MSc Computer Science Student at [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/) & [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/nl). My track is Big Data Engineering.**

\
My research interests mainly lie in translate the clinical question into a problem that can be interpreted by AI models and mining medical data.

I received my BSc in Software Engineering from [Macau University of Science and Technology.](https://www.must.edu.mo/en)My supervior is subrota kumar mondal. The thesis is using different deep learning models to detect COVID-19.
